# Miscellaneous Python utilities

As the title says, various classes and methods I've written that are useful to me and maybe you too.

## Contents
- `Box.py`: 2D box operations, similar to shapely's `box`.
  - draw to tkinter or opencv
  - get area, perimeter, center, intersection, etc.
  - switch between `x1, y1, x2, y2` and `x, y, w, h` representations
- `repl.py`: A simple REPL for Python. Useful for debugging.
- `talk.py`: cross-platform, zero-dependency text-to-speech using OS's built-in TTS engine.
